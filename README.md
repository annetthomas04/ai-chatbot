Created an AI-powered financial chatbot for BCG X, integrated and interpreted complex financial data from 10-K and 10-Q reports providing user-friendly financial insights.

The chatbot I have created is a simple, interactive chatbot that assesses financial data for the companies: Microsoft, Tesla and Apple from the csv file I compiled and runs based on rule-based logic. It replies to predefined queries about different financial metrics like revenue, net income growth and the asset to liability ratio i.e a company's financial health.

Currently the predefined queries the chatbot can respond to are:
1. What is the total revenue?
2. How has net income changed over the last year?
3. What is the asset to liability ratio?

The chatbot's functionality is that it can take user input and give a suitable answer based on the data it extracts from the csv file. The limitation is that it can only answer predefined queries and might cause errors in the case of missing values.
